# RefArch Diagram Generator

A React application that allows you to generate and visualize a security focused reference architecture diagram using a swimlane layout. The application provides drag-and-drop functionality for creating, moving, and organizing blocks within swimlanes. It is designed to assist in planning and visualizing various components of an architectural design.

## Features

- Create and organize blocks representing different aspects of the architecture.
- Drag and drop blocks within swimlanes to reorganize and update the diagram.
- Customize block colors to indicate different categories or priorities.
- Generate a PNG image of the diagram for documentation or sharing purposes.
- Reset the diagram to its initial state or clear specific swimlanes.

## To Do
- Export to Different Formats: In addition to PNG, provide options to export diagrams in other formats such as SVG, PDF, or even as JSON data.
- Import and Edit Saved Diagrams: Allow users to import previously saved diagrams and edit them further.
- Undo/Redo Functionality: Implement undo and redo functionality to allow users to revert changes made to the diagram.
- Interactive Documentation: Integrate the generated diagrams into an interactive documentation platform where users can click on blocks for more detailed information.
- User Authentication and Personalization: Implement user authentication to allow users to save and access their diagrams securely. Also, provide options for customizing the look and behavior of the diagram.
- Block Grouping: Allow users to group related blocks together for better organization and visualization.
- Print Stylesheet: Create a print-friendly stylesheet that optimizes the diagram layout for printing.
- Keyboard Shortcuts: Provide keyboard shortcuts for common actions such as adding blocks, generating images, or resetting the diagram.
- Theming: Add support for theming the application so users can choose different visual styles.
- Interactive Tutorials: Include interactive tutorials or tooltips to guide users through using the application effectively.
- Export Data: Allow users to export the diagram data in a structured format (such as JSON or CSV) for further analysis or integration.
- Dynamic Swimlane Generation: Modify the Swimlane component to dynamically generate lanes based on an array of lane names. This allows you to easily add more lanes in the future without having to change the component structure.
- Lane Customization: Provide users with the ability to add, edit, or remove lanes and actors directly from the user interface. This way, users can tailor the swimlane layout to their specific needs.
